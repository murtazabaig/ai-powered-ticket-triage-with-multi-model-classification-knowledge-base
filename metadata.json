  "description": "HOW IT WORKSThis workflow automates enterprise ticket management by combining AI-poweredclassification with knowledge base retrieval. It receives support tickets viawebhook, routes them through multiple AI models (OpenAI ChatGPT, NVIDIA's textclassification APIs, and embeddings-based search) to determine optimalresolution strategies. The system generates contextual diagnostic logs, formatsresponses, updates ticket systems, notifies engineers when escalation is needed,and seamlessly integrates with knowledge bases for continuous learning. Itsolves the critical problem of manual ticket sorting and delayed responses byautomating intelligent triage, reducing resolution time, and ensuring consistentquality across support operations. Target audience includes support operationsteams, technical support managers, and enterprises managing high-volume ticketqueues seeking to improve efficiency and SLA compliance.SETUP STEPS 1. Configure the OpenAI API key in credentials. 2. Add NVIDIA API credentials for embedding and classification models. 3. Set up Google Sheets for knowledge base storage and retrieval. 4. Connect your ticketing system (Jira, Zendesk, or webhook) for incoming tickets. 5. Link a notification service (Gmail or Slack) for engineer alerts. 6. Map custom fields to your ticket system schema.PREREQUISITESOpenAI API account with GPT access. NVIDIA API credentials (Embeddings &Classification). Google Sheets for KB management. Ticketing system with webhookcapability.USE CASESSaaS support teams triaging 100+ daily tickets, reducing manual sorting by 80%.Technical support escalating complex issues intelligently while documentingsolutions.CUSTOMIZATIONSwap OpenAI models for Claude or Anthropic APIs. Replace Google Sheets withdatabase systems (PostgreSQL, Airtable).BENEFITSReduces manual ticket sorting by 70-80%, freeing support staff for complexissues. Decreases average resolution time through intelligent routing.",
